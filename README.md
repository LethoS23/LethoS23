🚀 About Me  
I'm a passionate Software Test Analyst who loves technology, automation, and ensuring software quality. When I'm not testing and breaking things (intentionally 😆), you can find me exploring nature 🌿, attending tech events 🤝, and learning new tools 🔧.  

🔥 What I Do  
- 🛠 Software Testing – Ensuring software works as expected (and catching those sneaky bugs 🐛)  
- 💡 Problem Solver – Love debugging and optimizing code for efficiency  
- 📂 Tech Stack – Python, SQL, Selenium, Git, and more!  
- 🎯 Continuous Learning – Always improving and exploring new technologies
